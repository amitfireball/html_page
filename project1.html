    <em>
      The <span style="color:blue"><b>Taj Mahal</b></span> meaning Crown of the Palace is an ivory-white
    marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian
    city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor,
    Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658),
    to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
    Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece
    of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
    and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

   <b>ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN </b></div>
   <p>
     <i>
       The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on
       design traditions of Persian and earlier
       Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration
       came from successful Timurid and Mughal
       buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the
       tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal
       dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb,
       Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called
       the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama
       Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal
       buildings were primarily constructed of
       red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use
       of white marble inlaid with semi-precious
       stones. Buildings under his patronage
       reached new levels of refinement.
